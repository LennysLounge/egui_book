There are essentially two ways you can layout your ui with egui.
The first way is by letting egui take care of the all layout automatically.
This way you add your widget to the ui and thats it.

The second way is to do a manual layout. Here you are helping egui along 
by manually creating regions within your ui and within these regions you let
the automatic layout flow do its thing.
