# Layout

The layout of the current ui decides where a widget is placed in the ui.
In this chapter we will discuss the public fields of the [`Layout`](https://docs.rs/egui/0.33.0/egui/struct.Layout.html) struct and explain how the function.

The Layout struct also contains multiple constructors to conveniently create Layouts. Understanding what these constructors do is easy enough by looking at the source which will
expose the underlying configuration of that Layout.
