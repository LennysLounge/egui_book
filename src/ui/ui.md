# Ui

Lets talk about `Ui`s.
When I talk about ui's im not talking about the user interface of your application as a whole but rather about an instance of the `Ui` struct.
You can thinkg of a ui as a container or a panel in your application.
That analogy doesn't fit perfectly but it is good enought.
Ui's are created and used all over the place and are the key to understanding layouting in egui.
So what are ui's exactly.

Ui's have a maximum size.
The name 'maximum size' is a little confusing.
Ui's can absolutely be bigger than their maximum size and sometimes it is expected for a ui to be bigger than its maximum size.
The maximum size of a ui is simply the size that is assigned to it by the parent ui.
Or in other words, it is the expected size of the ui.


Ui's have a maximum size.
As the name suggests this is the maximum size
